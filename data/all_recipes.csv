Select your protein powder and add a type of flour to it. Makes sure to select a flour that can be eaten raw: coconut flour, almond flour, or a grain-based flour like oat flour or quinoa flour are all good choices.
2. Bind the powder and flour with milk. You can use cow's milk, coconut milk in a carton, or a tasty nut milk like almond milk. If you want, you can also add nut butter. You want to add enough liquid, (and nut butter if you like), to make the batter come together like dough. The goal is to end up with a batter that you can form into bars with your hands.
3. Shape the batter into bars. If, after mixing your ingredients, your batter is too moist or sticky to mold, add a tiny bit of coconut flour or casein powder until you get the desired consistency. You want to be able to shape the bars, so getting the batter dry enough is essential. If, after mixing your ingredients, the batter is too dry, add a bit of milk until you get the desired consistency. Don't make it too liquid-y though, or you'll have to go back to adding flour.
4. Melt some chocolate in a bain-marie or in a glass bowl on top of a pot of boiling water. Once it's melted, dunk the bars in the chocolate or pour it over the bars. I like to coat my bars in 90-100% chocolate, but you can go as dark (or light) as you want. Obviously, the darker the chocolate, the less sugar and more antioxidant goodness it contains. In my experience, really bitter chocolate goes extremely well with sweet fillings. But like I say, it's up to you.

Because there's no yeast in this recipe, you can have warm cinnamon rolls on your table in 30 minutes or less. The texture is doughy with firm edges, just like you'd expect from a fresh-baked cinnamon roll, and the flavor...oh my freaking wow, the flavor!

4. Knead the dough with your hands until it sticks to itself. If the dough still seems too crumbly after working it with your hands, add more milk a teaspoon at a time. Don't add too much, or the dough will become impossibly sticky!
5. Place your ball of dough on a lightly floured surface, like a clean kitchen counter. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough in all directions until it's about half an inch thick.
6. Cut off the uneven edges to make a square, and place the dough ""scraps"" in the center of your square. Roll out the dough again until it is an even thickness, keeping a square-ish shape.
7. Mix up your cinnamon filling, and spread it over your dough square, all the way to the edges.
8. Cut your square in half, then into sixths to make long, even strips.
9. One at a time, carefully roll each strip up onto itself, gently scraping the dough away from any ""sticky"" spots. Place finished rolls in a cake pan lightly coated with cooking spray.
10. Bake for 10-15 minutes until edges are lightly browned and firm but the center is soft (mine were done at exactly 12 minutes).
11. While the rolls bake, hand-mix or blend frosting ingredients until smooth in a medium bowl.
12. Once the rolls are done, spread them with frosting immediately. This recipe makes plenty of extra frosting, enough to completely smother your rolls!
13. Enjoy warm or slightly cooled the same day. Storing in the fridge or freezer will dry out the rolls."

2. Form the meat into four 6-ounce patties (they'll be 4 ounces once cooked). Make sure they're less than half an inch thick. Because this meat is so lean, you want it to cook quickly and evenly so the burgers are uniform and juicy.
3. To make the avocado spread, mash the avocado with a sprinkle of salt, a bit of red and black pepper, a squeeze of lime, and a couple sprigs of cilantro until the desired consistency is reached.
4. Place the burgers in a skillet on medium-high heat, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Insider tip: Use your finger to place a ""dimple"" in each patty. This will allow them to cook evenly and stay flat.
5. Once your patties have cooked on one side, flip them over, and sprinkle them with cheddar. Add a bit of water to the pot and cover it—this will create steam to melt the cheese.
6. Place both burgers on a bun, and top them with tomato and avocado spread. Add baked prosciutto and red onion if desired."

First, make your pancake mix by blending all the cannoli ingredients together. Fry up four little round pancakes in a hot non-stick pan coated with low-calorie spray or coconut oil. Bear in mind that you can make three bigger pancakes or even five smaller ones, depending on how big you like your cannoli. To make sure you don't overcook the pancakes, flip and remove them from the pan as soon as they're cooked, but before they brown.
2. Wrap each pancake around a cannoli mold or raw cannelloni.
3. Spray your non-stick pan with more low-calorie spray or coconut oil. Once it's hot, hot, hot, manually press your shaped pancake on it to fry each side. As you fry the pancake, you should notice it start to retain its tubular shape. Do this with all the pancakes.
4. Once your pancakes are all cannoli-shaped, make your frosting by mixing the ricotta with the protein powder. You can do this in a bowl with a spoon.
5. Make your own piping bag! Stick the filling mixture in a small ziplock bag and cut off the corner of the bag to transform it into a pastry chef's proper-presentation must.
6. Stuff your cannoli.
7. Garnish with melted chocolate, ground pistachios, or whatever you fancy.
8. Munch!
9. Note: The method above still leaves the cannoli a bit pancakey instead of giving it that flat-out crunch. If you want to get the proper crispy texture, you have two options. Option one, use oil instead of low-calorie spray when you fry the cannoli into shape. Option two, start off with more of a dough instead of a batter and wrap that around each cannoli mold. I didn't do it this way because it's a bit more complicated, but it can certainly be done."

4. Cover the surface of the pan with the batter in a thin layer. Spread the batter by moving the pan or by spreading it with a spoon or spatula.
5. Flip each crepe as soon as bubbles begin to form on its surface. Then, allow the other side to cook—it should only take a few seconds—until it gets golden brown.

3. Make your filling by blending the filling ingredients together using an immersion blender, regular blender, or food processor. Pour this onto the base.
4. Bake at 320 F (160 C) for 45-50 minutes, or until the filling has cooked through. Be careful not to overbake it. To ensure a creamy center, remove your pie as soon as it's cooked through—you'll know when an inserted knife comes out clean.
5. Let the pie cool before slicing and … that's it! Eat with abandon!
6. Note: If you want to make your pumpkin pies without crust—thereby removing most of the carbs and the fat—just bake the filling inside of silicone muffin molds for 35-40 minutes at 338 F (170 C). Let the muffins cool before uncasing them, and voila: crust-free mini pumpkin protein pies!

To make your bread lower in carbs, you can substitute the banana for some pumpkin or butternut squash puree. As long as you use banana-flavored whey protein powder, you should end up with tasty banana bread. You can also eliminate the dates but, if you do, I suggest you add in some sweetener to ensure the bread hits all the right notes.
If you don't have banana whey protein powder, a vanilla whey protein will work just as well!
If you want to use casein, you can. Just use 1/4 extra cup of liquid egg whites (or two whole eggs).
Consider adding some seeds to the mix! Flaxseeds or poppy seeds are a delicious addition."

2. Roast them at 350 F (around 180 C) for 8-12 minutes. Keep an eye on them so they don't burn. You'll know they're ready when they appear brown and sweaty—that's when they start releasing their oils.
3. As soon as the nuts are ready, throw them in a food processor and pulse them for about 5 minutes. Stop every 30 seconds to give the mix a churn. While it might seem like it's taking ages, your mixture will turn from a grainy mix to a creamy and beautiful butter. If, for whatever reason, you still have a grainy mixture after 5 minutes, add a bit of the oil to help the process along. While you don't have to add the additional fat, it will help cut down on the time you have to stand there pulsing the nuts.
4. Once your butter is ready, it's time to flavor it! You can add some sea salt if you want it salty or, if you want it sweet, check out the recipes below. The macros listed are for the entire batch—serving size is up to your discretion.
5. Important notes on flavoring and protein-packing: Adding whey protein to your nut butters will make them a bit grainier. To counter this, play around with the proportions of whey to nut butter until you reach your desired consistency. If you want to up the protein content of your nut butters even more, you can use more of the whey protein. Just remember to bind it with the rest of the ingredients by adding a tiny bit of water into your mix—not a lot, though. Remember, we're not making a soup here!"
